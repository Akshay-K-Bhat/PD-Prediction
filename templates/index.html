            <h2>About Parkinson's Disease</h2>
            <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. The early signs of
                the disease include tremors, slowness of movement, stiffness, and impaired balance. As the disease
                progresses, it can also cause non-motor symptoms such as cognitive changes, depression, and sleep
                disturbances.</p>
